# Mr-Potatohead
App 1 from course Native App Studio

## Extra's
The code for this app has been greatly optimised and is DRY as of now.
As a nice extra, the backround of the app was changed to reflect the original movie location, Andy's room. The checkboxes were colored
using a highly transparent white to increase the contrast.

## Summary
This app is a dress-up game starring the Disney Pixar character Mr. Potatohead. The app uses checkboxes to dress or undress Mr Potatohead.
There is a total of 10 body parts to append or remove. The app works both in landscape and portrait mode.
